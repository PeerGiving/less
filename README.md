PeerGiving is a fundraising platform that empowers charities and their fundraisers to succeed. 

To match the look and feel of a PeerGiving instance to a charity's brand, a front-end developer will need to reference code from this reposity.

##Overview
The primary styling file for every PeerGiving instance is [css/styles.less](https://github.com/PeerGivingSolutions/themes/blob/master/css/styles.less). This file pulls in all styles for an unbranded PeerGiving product.
