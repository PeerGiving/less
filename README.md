PeerGiving is a fundraising platform that empowers charities and their fundraisers to succeed. 

To match the look and feel of a PeerGiving instance to a charity's brand, a front-end developer will need to reference code from this reposity.

##Overview
The primary styling file for the PeerGiving platform is css / [**styles.less**](https://github.com/PeerGivingSolutions/themes/blob/master/css/styles.less). This file pulls in all required styles for an unbranded PeerGiving product (including the Boostrap framework).

The primary styling file for a given PeerGiving instance/theme is App_Themes/(instance-id) / **styles.less**
